                <h1 class="choose">Why I choose IT?</h1>
                <p>Why I choose IT? There are two reason why I choose IT

                    out of all the courses in college. The first one is, when I graduated
                    
                    from high school, I have no idea what strand I will take in senior
                    
                    high school and still pursue it in college. I do not have any interest in
                    
                    any course in senior high school. So, I did some research on the
                    
                    internet about 'In demand and high paying jobs in the Philippines'.
                    
                    After searching on different sites, most jobs are inclined to
                    
                    technology, which I agreed on because our technology is advancing
                    
                    so fast day by day. Second, after I graduated from senior high school,
                    
                    I'm having second thoughts if I will still pursue IT in college. Just like
                    
                    I said, I feel IT is not for me. But then, curiosity got me when I was
                    
                    watching gameplays. I find it fascinating that game developers can
                    
                    be creative on developing a game. So I said to my inner self,
                    
                    'I have to
                    
                    learn how to develop a game on my own'. And that is the two mainly
                    
                    reason why I choose IT.

                <p>If you love the things that you do, you will never get

                    tired of it. My future in IT industry is gonna be tiring to my
                    
                    future self, I know it. Facing my desktop, doing programming
                    
                    for work because it is due tomorrow, learning programming
                    
                    languages and developing my own game so I can do what my
                    
                    goal is at the first place on why I choose IT, and repeat every
                    
                    other day. I can still see myself in IT industry in the near
                    
                    future, and still discovering new fields in IT. Overall, my
                    
                    future in IT industry is gonna be hard and tiring, mainly after
                    
                    I graduated in college and finding a job. It is gonna be
                    
                    competitive in the IT industry and it belongs on facing the
                    
                    responsibilities as an adult.
